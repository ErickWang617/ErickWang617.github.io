			<h3>Fusilli with Spicy Meat Sauce</h3>
			<p>Fusili are a variety of pasta that has a very unique, helical shape. In my opinion, they are the best type of pasta since the twirls act as small crevices that can capture a lot of sauce and great amounts of flavor! Fusilli is thicker than the typical pasta styles, so it will take 10-15 minutes for al dente. This recipe does not have a lot of ingredients and is a greate example of a beginner dish. With good multi-tasking and awareness, this dish should not take more than 25 minutes.</p>

			<h4> Needed Ingredients </h4>

			<ul class = "ingredients">
				<li>Ground Beef</li>
