			<h4>Steps: </h4>
			<ol class = "steps">
				<li>Cut chicken breast into 1-2 inch cubes and season it with salt, cumin, paprika, garlic & onion powder.</li>
				<li>Get a large ziplock bag and dump the chipotle peppers and adobo sauce into the bag. Place the seasoned chicken inside the bag as well and tightly squeeze out the air in the bag and let it marinate for at least 3 hours or even overnight in the refridgerator.</li>
				<li>Once chicken is well marinated, take it out of the fridge and let it cool in room temperature. Begin preparing the rice by steaming it or microwaving (depending on the rice brand).</li>
				<li>In a pan, bring the heat to a medium and empty the can of beans of your choice into the pan and add a pinch of salt. Cook and stir for about 10 minutes and remove beans from pan into a separate dish.</li>
				<li>Using the same pan, place the marinated chicken in and cook and flip until a brown crust begins to form on the exterior. Similar to the previous step, remove chicken from pan into a separate dish.</li>
				<li>Now let's begin constructing the burrito. Place tortilla on a plate or in a pan and add a generous amount of rice, beans, chicken, cheese, and any sauce of your choice.</li>
				<li>Wrap burrito tighty and then place it back on the pan and cook each side of the burrito until tortilla begins to brown to produce a crunchy texture. </li>
				<li>Remove from pan and enjoy your meal!</li>
